# ChainHopper: Investment Thesis

## What We're Building

ChainHopper is a multi-chain DEX aggregator with a profit-share fee model. Users trade across 12 chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Sui, TON, Eclipse, etc.) through a single interface. Instead of charging swap fees, we take 15% of realized profits—meaning we only make money when traders make money.

The stack is live with integrations into 1inch, Jupiter, Cetus, STONfi, and chain-native DEXes like DragonSwap (Kaia) and SwapX (Sonic).

## Where the Alpha Is

**1. Underserved L2s and alt-L1s**
Kaia, Sonic, Eclipse, and Berachain have limited aggregator coverage. We're often the only unified interface routing through their native DEXes. Early liquidity on these chains = better rates for users = stickiness.

**2. Profit-share model creates moat**
Traditional aggregators charge flat fees regardless of outcome. Our model attracts traders who are fee-sensitive or experimenting with new chains. Lower barrier to try = higher conversion.

**3. Telegram distribution**
The bot interface taps into TON's 900M+ user base. Most competitors are web-only.

## Realistic Return Expectations

Being honest: this is early-stage DeFi infrastructure. Revenue depends on trading volume.

| Monthly Volume | Est. Profit Generated | Our 15% Take |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| $1M            | ~$30K (3% avg gain)  | $4,500       |
| $10M           | ~$300K               | $45,000      |
| $50M           | ~$1.5M               | $225,000     |

To hit $10M monthly volume, we need ~2,000 active traders averaging $5K/month. Achievable within 6-12 months post-launch with proper distribution, but not guaranteed.

**Break-even**: ~$2M monthly volume covers modest operating costs (infra, RPCs, oracle fees).

## Capital Requirements

**Minimum viable launch: $80-120K**
- Smart contract audits: $30-50K (critical for trust)
- Initial liquidity incentives: $20-30K
- Infrastructure (RPCs, indexers, hosting): $15-20K for 12 months
- Marketing/community: $15-20K

**Comfortable runway (18 months): $200-250K**
- Adds buffer for second audit, additional chain deployments, and hiring one full-time dev.

## Grant Potential

Realistically targeting $60-100K in ecosystem grants:

| Chain/Foundation | Ask      | Likelihood | Notes |
|------------------|----------|------------|-------|
| Sui Foundation   | $25-30K  | High       | Active grant program, we have working adapter |
| Sonic Labs       | $15-20K  | Medium     | Newer chain, eager for DeFi tooling |
| Kaia Foundation  | $15-20K  | Medium     | DragonSwap integration is live |
| Eclipse          | $10-15K  | Medium     | SVM grants exist, smaller pool |
| TON Foundation   | $20-25K  | Medium-Low | Competitive, but bot angle helps |

**Conservative estimate**: $40-60K confirmed within 3-4 months
**Optimistic**: $80-100K if we land 4+ grants

## The Ask

Looking for $150K to cover 12-month runway with audits. Grants could offset 30-50% of that, bringing the external raise to **$75-100K**.

Token or equity structure TBD based on investor preference.
