## Security Incidents

### All Major Bots Were Exploited

| Bot | Date | Loss | Cause |
|-----|------|------|-------|
| Maestro | Oct 2023 | $500K | Router contract vulnerability |
| Unibot | Oct 2023 | $640K | Call injection exploit |
| Banana Gun | Sep 2024 | $3M | Telegram message oracle |

### Common Vulnerabilities
1. Private key exposure (custodial designs)
2. Router contract bugs
3. Oracle manipulation
4. SIM-swapping attacks
5. Telegram phishing (2000% increase in 2024)

### Our Security Posture
- Non-custodial (no private key storage)
- Timelock on admin functions
- Chainlink/Pyth oracles (not DEX spot)
- Mandatory Slither + Mythril
- Clear phishing warnings

---

## Chain Landscape

### Solana (70%+ of volume)
- Dominated by Trojan, Axiom, BONKbot
- Memecoin boom (Pump.fun) drove growth
- Highly competitive, hard to differentiate

### Ethereum/EVM
- Banana Gun leads via sniping superiority
- Fragmented across L2s
- MEV concerns

### Emerging Chains (OUR OPPORTUNITY)

| Chain | Bot Landscape | Why Target |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Sonic** | Zero bots | Sub-second finality, 10K+ TPS |
| **Kaia** | Zero bots | 250M LINE/Kakao users |
| **Berachain** | Zero bots | $3B TVL, unique PoL arbitrage |
| **Sui** | Fragmented | 120K TPS, $0.01 fees |
| **TON** | Limited | Native Telegram (but low volume risk) |

**Warning**: TonTradingBot shut down due to insufficient volume. Don't over-invest in TON.
