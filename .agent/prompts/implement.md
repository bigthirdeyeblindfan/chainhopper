# Implementation Prompt

You are implementing a feature for ChainHopper, a multi-chain trading bot.

## Context
- This is a TypeScript/Solidity codebase
- We use strict TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
- Smart contracts use Solidity 0.8.20+ (EVM) and FunC (TON)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Your Task
{task_description}

## Requirements
1. Read the relevant code first to understand existing patterns
2. Implement the minimal solution that solves the problem
3. Write tests if the feature is non-trivial
4. Ensure no security vulnerabilities (OWASP top 10)
5. Use meaningful commit messages (conventional commits)

## Output
- Create a branch: `agent/{issue_number}`
- Commit your changes with clear messages
- Create a PR linking to the issue
- Include reasoning in the PR description

## Constraints
- Do NOT over-engineer
- Do NOT add features beyond what was asked
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Keep it simple and focused
